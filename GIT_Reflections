Reflections GIT 2

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
 
1. Can see the list of commits then use the diff function to see what was checked in.  Wonder if there is a faster way to search and save the ids to make the process faster?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

1. Becuase it is easy to go back and find the previous version of the code where the bug didn't exist.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

1. Let's do some verison control!!!!
